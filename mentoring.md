## Pre-submission Mentorship Program

The SRW offers students the opportunity to get feedback in advance to submitting their work for review. The goal of the pre-submission mentorship program is to improve the quality of writing and presentation of the student's work, not to critique the work itself. Participation is optional but encouraged and pre-submission mentorship is not anonymous. Details will be forthcming. 

Students wishing to participate must submit the paper by --January 15-- **January 22, 2018** via [naacl2018-srw+prementoring@googlegroups.com](mailto:naacl2018-srw+prementoring@googlegroups.com) along the followings included in the body of the e-mail. 

1. A copy of the paper (PDF format)
1. E-mail addresses of all authors (for correspondence)
1. Author keywords and the area of the research (see [here](http://naacl2018.org/call_for_paper.html) for relevant topics and areas)
1. Any specific questions for mentors or expected types of feedback

Participants will receive a mentor who will review and provide feedback to the student within 4 weeks. This mentor will not be the same person who will review the final submission. The feedback will be in the format of guidelines and suggestions to improve the overall writing; students are not required to make the changes suggested by the pre-submission mentor.

## Mentoring of Accepted Papers

There will also be mentors who provide feedback to students in the form of in-depth comments and questions for the workshop presentation.
